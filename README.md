React App for rendering data from USGS website.

With such an overload of data on the site, and the hard-to-navigate UI, it's difficult to get on the site and quickly get the basic data a fly fisherman might want on a river (i.e. the current flows).

I built this so a user can quickly find the river they're looking for and get only the data they actually want.

Most fisherman don't want all the scientific data behind a river, they just want to see the flows.

The rest of the river's data is also availalable if needed.

Spun up with CRA, styling is Tailwind.
